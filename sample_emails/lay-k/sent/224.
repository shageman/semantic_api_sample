Mr. Lay,

Verizon Enterprise Solutions group invites you to play a round of golf
with a professional golfer at our Gold Pro-Am golf event at the 2001
Byron Nelson.   Being that Verizon is the major sponsor, we have first
choice!  This is a first class event, with details in the enclosed
document.  Please reply if you have any interest in this event by the
end of business Monday, April 2nd.
