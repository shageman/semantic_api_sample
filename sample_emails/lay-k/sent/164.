Hi Liz -

You e-mail worked perfectly.  I was going into the board meeting when it was 
received, so sorry I didn't respond.  Your Dad hasn't seen your message yet, 
but hopefully he can call this afternoon.  I hope that works for you.  He is 
leaving early this afternoon as he and Linda have an appointment at 4:30.

Dad,
I need to talk to you about the contract I am drafting
and wanted to know a good time to call. Can you please
let me know when we can schedule a call. It should
only take about 15 minutes.
Thanks
Elizabeth
