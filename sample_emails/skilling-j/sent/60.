Hello, Mike.

11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building 
(1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick 
tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make 
sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and 
send you to the 50th floor.

I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in 
particular you like?  SRS
