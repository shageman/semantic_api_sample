Subject: Employee Communications with OOC

Ken/Jeff/Joe:

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Brian
