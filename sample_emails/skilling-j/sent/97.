Subject: Schmalbach-Lubeca missing invoices

Would you please provide the following missing invoices: 05-00(1), 05-00(2), 
06-00(1), 06-00(3) and  07-00(1).  These invoices will help with keeping the 
back up information and the reconciliation for the FTR.  If you would please 
get these to me by tomorrow I will be able to start the project.  Thank you 
for your assistance and consideration.  If there are any questions are 
concerns feel free to contact me.
