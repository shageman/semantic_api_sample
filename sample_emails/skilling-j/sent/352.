Subject: Elektrobolt FASH changes

Some additional language has been added to the FASH with regards to the 
financing conditions in Brazil.  This updated FASH is the one that will be 
signed in connection with the DASH that is currently circulating for 
signatures.  If there are any questions on the additional comments please 
call myself (35274) or Joe Deffner (37117) or Peter Anderson (67579).
