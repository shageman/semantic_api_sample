Mr. Paul,

Jeff asked me to see if I could find out when the Homecoming is taking 
place.  He'd like to be there if the dates work with his schedule.

Thank you,

Jeff,  how was the bike trek to Austin?  Hope you raised LOTS of $$$.  Great
job you are doing!  My MS get together is next weekend (May 13th).

Homecoming 2000-be there!  Elvis is having a party for all Beta's (big 25th
reunion) on Friday night at his house.  The new stadium is supposed to be
awesome.  Hope you can make it.

Keep in touch,

-kai-

Chuck
