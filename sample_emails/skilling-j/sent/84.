I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed 
the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out 
what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's 
unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he 
will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events 
scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.

Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any 
assistance is greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
