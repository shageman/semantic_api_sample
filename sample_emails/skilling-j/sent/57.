Dear John,

On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
before Jeff saw a printed copy.

Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
pursue this opportunity.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
on behalf of Jeff Skilling
