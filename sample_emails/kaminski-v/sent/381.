Dave,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to join you at the dinner 
and on Saturday.
I shall come alone: my wife will stay with my son in California
till June (my son graduates this spring from college).

I shall remind Andy Fastow about NFCF.

Vince

Vince,
It was good seeing you again today.  I want to make sure the NFCF is on
your calendar for May 4-5.   You should be receiving some registration
materials shortly.

Please plan on coming if you can.
Also, please attend the dinner on Friday evening along with your wife if
possible.

Regards,
Dave
