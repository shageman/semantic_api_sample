Julie,

A few issues.

1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
Houston):

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the ebst
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

Vince
