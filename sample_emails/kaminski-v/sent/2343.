Subject: John Sherriff's Copper Position

Hi Esther,

I just talked to John Sherriff about his "Enron" copper position.  I suspect 
that this is not currently being captured within the MG Mercur position 
database - he would like to have that included in the VaR spreadsheet and 
shown as a separate line.  Do you have any information regarding this deal 
(i.e. position sizes, qualities etc.) or be able to direct me to someone who 
may be able to assist in getting this information?

Thanks,

Anjam
