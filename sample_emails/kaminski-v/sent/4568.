Jason,

There was a problem with the request. I could not approve it (the system would
not let me do it). There must have been a  mistake in the way it was 
submitted).
Please, ask Shirley to resubmit.

Vince

Subject: Additional Bloomberg terminal for weather group on 31st floor

Vince,

A few weeks ago we talked about installing an additional Bloomberg terminal 
on the 31st floor for Mike's weather team.
 I have submitted a security request, and we are now waiting for your 
approval.  
Could you, please, go over that request and give Mike Roberts and me your 
feedback?

Jason Sokolov
