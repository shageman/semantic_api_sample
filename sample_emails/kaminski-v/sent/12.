Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is 
not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him 
with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne
