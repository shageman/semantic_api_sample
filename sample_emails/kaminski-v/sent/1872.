Vince,

I have received the full-time offer package from Associate & Analyst Program
last week. Apparently they have pretty tight deadlines. Because of a certain
clause in the contract, I may have to give them an answer by October 16th.
Since we discussed this before I left Enron, I felt it would be a good idea
to inform you of the recent developments.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding both part-time and
full-time employment opportunities with the Research Group.

Best,
