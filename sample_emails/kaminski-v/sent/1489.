Hello Charlene,

I am forwarding you a resume of a student from Berkeley. 
We would  like very much to have him as a summer intern with my group.

Please, let me know if your program can accommodate him.

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski

I am currently pursuing the M.S. in IEOR at UC Berkeley. I attended the 
speech you gave some weeks ago.

I am interested in summer internship positions available in Enron. You will 
find enclosed my resume.

Sincerely,

Ezequiel Luis
