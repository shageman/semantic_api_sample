Subject: Clean Fuels - GPG business segment

Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and 
methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group 
in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.  

With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price 
environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will 
political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.  

Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North 
American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain 
higher than the rest of the world.

Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most 
helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of 
your group as soon as convenient.

Thanks, sorry we missed you today.
