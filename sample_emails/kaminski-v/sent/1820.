Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy
