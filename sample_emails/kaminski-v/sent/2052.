Jeff, 

Christ, Mark and myself are planning to visit Tom Piazze in October. I talked 
to Christy about Wharton
and she will be calling Tom to set it up.

Hi Vince,

I just got off the phone with donna piazze at Wharton, (I don't know if there 
is a relationship with Tom at Wharton), and we were discussing there Tiger 
Teams.  It is a required research program, 2nd semester for MBAs, and Wharton 
would love to have Enron participate.  I told her there is probably some real 
life reasearch project we could have the students do.  She did  also mention 
that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton..  I 
gave her your number.

Her number is 215 573 8394.  Please call her when you get a chance within the 
week.

Mark, can we get christy involved?  Thanks everyone.

Jeff
