Dear Vince,
1.Thanks for the beautiful"parchemin"
2.I am glad I bought some Enron shares after meeting
Mr Skilling last April with Bob Merton
3.After a terrible month of January,we may have found
a possible route to improve my son's health
4.We have added to our software forward start plain-
vanilla and Asian options,caps,floors(consistently
with the Asian options and swaptions);a whole variety
of swings of different specifications.
I really believe it is quite good(in particular the consistent
modelling of forward &Futures price moves)
I am putting a new brochure in the mail for you and
would be delighted if you decided to use part of it
(or the totality!)as a comparison with your own results.
Kind regards
Helyette
