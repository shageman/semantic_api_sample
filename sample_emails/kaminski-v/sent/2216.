Greg,

Blake Johnson sent me this proposal (I think some of his friends are
the founders of this group). It looks like a good project for Brad Romine
to evaluate it.

Vince,

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.
