Vince-
I am with the EBS Venture Capital group. We are looking at evaluating an 
investment in a company called Widevine out of Seattle. Part of their value 
proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming. Are you familiar 
with that? If so, can I set a meeting with you and a few other members of my 
group to discuss on Tuesday or Wednesday?
