Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to 
graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative 
capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I 
might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am 
unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by 
your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my 
resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,


 Ian McCracken
