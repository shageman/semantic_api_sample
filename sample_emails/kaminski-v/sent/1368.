Hi Helyette,

Congratulations on your papers.

The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals
(it's circulating through different parts of the company
where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute
the contract  in the first few days of December.

I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

Vince

Dear Vince,
I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show
in Paris.In my case,it is the same:I got 3 papers accepted in THE
3 major Journals in Finance(Journal of Business,Journal of Finance
and Journal of Financial Economics).We should write a piece!
Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people.My
lawyer had added a paragraph to Karla's document:since she had
mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source
etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G
disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to
use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am
striking an agreement with a software company ,13years with
people from Polytechnique+finance,to be our hot line(with us paying
royalties,of course).This would complement my 2 associates.
Looking forward to hearing from you
Helyette
