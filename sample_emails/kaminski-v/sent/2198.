Per mail dated June 15 from Kim Watson,  there was supposed to have occurred 
a true-up of $274.7 in July for the fist six months of 2000.  Reviewing July 
actuals,  I was not able to locate this entry.  Would you pls let me know 
whether this entry was made,  if not,  when do you intend to process it .  
thanks.
