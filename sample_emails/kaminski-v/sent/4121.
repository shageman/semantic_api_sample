Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Keith Shaw

We,re back again with more white papers to whet your appetite! Our
continuing mission is to provide you with the latest technology and
product information, right from the vendors themselves, as well as a
quick summary and link to the white paper itself.

This week we,ve got white papers on Windows 2000 migration, IP version
6 and SNMP version 3, Layer 4 switching and Web switching, and how to
integrate security for your e-business. Enjoy!

InstallShield Software Corp.
NetInstall and Microsoft Windows 2000

Windows 2000 offers built-in client management capabilities,
collectively known as the &IntelliMirror8 technologies. But if you,re
going to realize the complete benefits of these technologies, you need
a complete implementation of Win 2000 across your enterprise. If you,re
going to have a mixed mode environment (Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4
servers or others) on the server or in a client-setting (Windows
95/98/NT clients), you may need NetInstall software products.

This paper looks at the Windows 2000 software installation process, as
well as the evolutionary path for enterprises going from non-Windows
2000-based to a mixed environment or a pure Windows 2000 environment.

Switching and Web switching, as well as do,s and don,ts when testing
Web switches.

DigiNet Corp. (produced in association with Network World Technical
Seminars)
Dealing with the Growth of the Internet

For most network managers, the explosive growth of the Internet isn,t
breaking news; they,ve lived with these issues on a daily basis. The
question now is how to manage it and plan for future growth.

This paper provides some insight into two significant architectural
enhancements to Internet technologies that promise to greatly enhance
the way we administer and manage internetworks and intranetworks in the
future  IP version 6 and SNMP version 3.
