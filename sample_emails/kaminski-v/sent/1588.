Subject: Fax Machines


After speaking with Iain Russell today and him coming to the Weather Group
noticing the fax machine , he mentioned that it is outdated and costing
a lot of money.
He made a phone call to get the old fax machine removed therefore we 
will receive new models soon.
We would save half the rental cost on these new machines.

FYI.

                                                          Thanks
                                                       Kevin Moore
