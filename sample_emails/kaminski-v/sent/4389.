Subject: Invitation to My House

Vince,
I hope you are well. Sorry I have not been in touch but I have been swamped 
trying to build my organization simultaneously as I endeavor to understand 
EBS and navigate its political terrain. Quite interesting. I shall tell you 
more later.
My wife, Elisabeth and I would love to have you for dinner at our house any 
Saturday at you convenience. Would please let me  know which Saturday would 
be suitable? We are both looking forward to it so please let me know.
Thanks,
Tony
