Donna,

Sorry to hear about it. I shall stop by tomorrow  to say hello.
It's too bad: so many good friends of mine will be leaving the comapny.

You have probably heard that our group is being broken up. Some people were 
put in other groups but I was not fortunate enough to be one of those 
people.  HR will try for the month of March to find a position for me within 
Enron but that is not likely to happen.

Tomorrow is my last full day here - I will be in and out for the month of 
March.

I am informing nice people that I like and you are one of those.
