Hi Jana,

I would like to invite you to visit us in the Woodlands one weekend in July.
My wife wants to make the house presentable after her long absence
and the months of my neglect.
I think I need the coming long weekend to clean up all the papers 
and we shall be ready. What about the following weekend or the next one?

Vince

Vince,
How are you?  I hope you and your family had a lovely trip.

I just came back from a Series 3 prep class in NY last week.  One of my
classmates is the new President and CEO of the Montreal Exchange in Canada.
(He thought this class was going to be more advanced)

He told me his exchange is interested in derivatives, and I immediately
thought of you.  I am going to email him your info, so that he might contact
you.  His name is Luc Bertrand.

Let me know when we might all get together.  I am sure your work schedule is
hectic after being out for awhile.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Jana
