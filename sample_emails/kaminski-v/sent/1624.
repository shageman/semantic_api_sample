Just a quick note to say that I have now left the EPRM/Risk conference
division after two and a half very happy years. I am however still at Risk
Waters Group, where I am now working as a journalist on EPRM magazine.
Future conference enquiries should go to Paul Bristow (US - 212 925 6990) or
Frances Tully (Europe - +44 (0) 20 7484 9731).

Many thanks for your work my events and I hope we can work together again in
the future. If you have any ideas on the writing side then I would always
appreciate a call or email - my contact details all remain the same.

Best regards,

Joel.
