Vince:

As you requested, we mailed you a brochure about our upcoming course
(2/22-4/4) in Houston.

We are now following up with that mailing to identify remaining
attendees for the session.  I wanted to make sure that we did not
overlook anyone at Enron, so I am dropping you this email to see if you
have anyone there in mind as an attendee.

Best regards,
