Dear Mr. Kaminski:

?

Shmuel Oren indicated that you said that you were interested in learning more 
about the Power Systems Engineering Research Center,s upcoming Industrial 
Advisory Board meeting. Thanks for your interest. 

?

Attached is file that describes the meeting,s objectives, agenda and 
attendees. It will be a very stimulating meeting given the mix of academic 
and industry attendees. We,re looking forward to the attendance by people 
from several ISO,s around the country as well ) a new addition to our 
attendee list.

?

I hope you will consider joining us. If you,d like more information about 
PSERC, you can find it on the web at www.pserc.wisc.edu. We,ll also be 
sending you some information.

?

By the way, you might be interested in an internet seminar we,re running 
tomorrow. The information is given below. It,s free except for the cost of 
learning how to use NetMeeting if you,ve not already been using it.

?

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

?

Regards,

?

Dennis Ray

Abstract

?

While the concept of ATC has been around for decades, the desire to

calculate its value on a large scale is new.? Organizations responsible for

the reliable operation of the transmission system are given the task of

determining ATC values on a daily basis.? ATC calculations typically include

a large number of contingencies as well as multiple transfer directions and

multiple system conditions.? This presents a labor-intensive task for those

required to calculate ATC values.

?

Because of these circumstances, Powerworld Corporation was approached by the

Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop a new software product for

their use in calculating ATC values.? The new ATC tool, integrated into the

Simulator OPF/ATC software product, was the culmination of this work.? This

talk will cover the basic engineering requirements and mathematics that

governed the development of the ATC tool.? The concept of Linear ATC

analysis will be introduced, along with the underlying mathematics of Linear

ATC analysis including

?

*? Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs)

*? Line Outage and Closure Distribution Factors (LODFs/LCDFs)

*? Outage Transfer Distribution Factors (OTDFs)

?

Attention will be paid to demonstrating the accuracy of Linear ATC on large

systems as well as demonstrating what Linear ATC does not model.? Examples

will be shown on both small and large-scale systems using Simulator OPF/ATC.

?

Other special topics integrated into PowerWorld Simulator OPF/ATC will also

be discussed such as (1) the inclusion of phase-shifting transformers

directly in linear analysis, and (2) the iteration of linear ATC for use in

modeling controller changes.

IP Address for Netmeeting

?

Read the instructions to down load and install Netmeeting.? At about 12.50

PM Central Time on November 7, 2000, dial the following IP address in

Netmeeting?? 128.174.115.8.? Please make sure the resolution on your machine

is set to 1024 x 768 .? This will be the setting on the machine at which the

Power Point slides originate.? If your machine is not set to the same

resolution, the slides on your machine during the seminar will lose

information.

Jamie Weber was born in Platteville, Wisconsin, on June 13, 1973.? He

received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of

Wisconsin - Platteville in May 1995 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in

electrical engineering from the University of Illinois in January 1997 and

October 1999.? He has worked part-time as a software developer at PowerWorld

?

Corporation since the company's inception in 1996, and has been employed

full-time at PowerWorld Corporation since February 1999.? His primary duties

include software development, consulting activities, and software training.

His research interests include power systems, economics, and computer

visualization.
