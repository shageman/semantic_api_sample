Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for calling.  Briefly, about IDEAglobal.com: we've been providing
unbiased market analysis since 1989, and today our customers include the
Fed, the US Treasury, the IMF, 25 foreign Central banks, and over 1,700
dealing rooms worldwide.  We emphasize sales and trading strategies rather
than just provide market news.

Attached, please find 2 samples of our daily research: today's issue of our
morning faxes Financial Markets Today and Fixed Income Today.  We also have
intraday market coverage on Bloomberg: IDEA>GO, Reuters, and
Bridge/Telerate.

If the info looks interesting, we would be glad to arrange a 30-day free
trial for you?  For your reference, please see our Price List.  I look
forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Vadim Pokhlebkin
