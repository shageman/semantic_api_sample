Darrell,

I am sending you 2 technical notes on Enron default swaps: I hope that they 
will
be useful. I shall read the articles on weekend. I am curious if you
find these explanations satisfactory.

We are very slow in preparing a number of technical documents
for you for model reviews. We still hope you will be able
to find some time to review our credit models (for our London
credit trading) and  VaR and option pricing related models.

Also, please check your invoices. I still think we owe you money.


Vince

Vince: According to a Bank of America
publication, your (Enron) default swap spreads
are consistently trading about 80
basis points wider than your asset swaps.
Any idea of what is going on here?

Thanks for any guidance, Darrell
