Anjam,

It makes sense to come to Houston for a longer time period.
I think that you should spend here at least 3 weeks.

Hi Vince,

One of my only windows of opportunity right now is to schedule the Houston 
visit for Monday 10th July for a single week only.

Regards,

Anjam

Vince, Dale

Here are our proposals for Houston visits from our group:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.
Matt  Not a permanent Research Group member.  I'm asking Richard's group to 
pay for his visit, probably in August.

Steve
