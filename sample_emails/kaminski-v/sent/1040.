Sam,

This is a partial list of people to whom I would like to send the volumes:

Volume 1 & 2

Winokur (Enron Board member, Shirley has his address)
Jeff Skilling
Ken Lay
Mark Frevert
Greg Whalley
Rick Buy
Jeff Shankman
John Lavorato
Dave Delainey


I shall write the cover letter.


Also, we can add additional volume for Kaminski's columns (just 10 copies),
including bios and my contributions.
I would like to show the depth of talent we have in the group.

Subject: Volume II of the Technical Corner Collection

Vince,

I have successfully integrated Martin's article into Volume II and am 
following Mike's instructions for reproduction.  I'm also having some 
additional Volume I's printed, too.  Would you mind disposing of the other 
set I gave you?  I wouldn't want things to get confused.  Also, I'm doing 20 
Volume I's and 60 Volume II's.  Please let me know how many you personally 
need and I will deliver them to your office.

Thank You,

Sam
