Look forward to meeting you in Houston. What about Wednesday,

Vince,

I'm  planning to be over for the management conference next week, arriving in 
Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  I would appreciate having an hour with you 
either then or on Wednesday.  Could you let me know if you are available 
please?

Thanks,
Tani
