Dear Vince:

     Happy New Year.

      Does Enron have a program for hiring summer interns?  My daughter
Candice Kao is a freshman at Mount Holyoke College.  She has a good quan
aptitude and quite meticulous.  She is looking for summer intership in
Houston.  So if you know such a program existing, please let me know.
She is in town for the semester break if there is such a program, may
be she can visit with someone there to have an interview.

      With best regards,  Ed
