Anjam,

Can you, please, invite Gordian Kemen to an interview in London?
Stinson, Zimin, Vasant and Krishna can interview
him from Houston (video conference).

Vince

Hi Vince,

Following up to our chat on the phone.

Gordian Kemen will be arriving in Austin on the 16th. He will be staying in 
Austin for 2 weeks. He would very much appreciate to have the opportunity to 
have a talk with you to find out if there is a place for him at Enron. You 
can reach him under (512) 301-9819 (his parents in law's phone number). 

Thanks a lot for you help and attention,

Jens
