Vincent,

I had to leave the conference early today, and I've just realised back in
the office as I went through my conference notes that I didn't receive a
copy of your presentation.  I'm not sure whether you gave out copies of your
presentaton or not.  However, if you did distribute copies at the
conference, would you be able to email me a copy?  No problems if you did
not give out copies or if you haven't got a copy handy.


Kind regards,
