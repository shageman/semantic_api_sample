You did it! Another MS 150 has come and gone and we,ve already begun
preparing for next year. We were blessed with beautiful weather again this
year, although it was a little too warm on Sunday. On behalf of the Lone
Star Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, thank you for
supporting the 2000 ISUZU MS 150 presented by The Home Depot!

Also, thank you for all of your calls, letters, and emails about the bike
tour. We,re still receiving a lot of positive feedback from riders saying
that this was the best MS 150 ever. We know you,re anxious to hear some
results, so here,s the latest:

&#61623; 7,500 people registered (2,440 registered online at
www.ms150.org)
&#61623; Approximately 6,500 people actually rode (based on packets picked
up)
&#61623; Total online donations at www.ms150.org as of April 28 = $186,389
&#61623; Number of hits per day at www.ms150.org = 65,000 +
&#61623; We,re still collecting and processing pledges daily, so we don,t
know how much money we,ve raised yet. However, it looks like we,re well on
our way to raising $3 million, if not more! If so, this will be the first
time any MS bike tour has ever raised $3 million! Please help us by
getting all pledges turned in by May 19.
&#61623; We,re thankful and proud to announce that there were no serious
injuries on the Tour this year. Yes, we did transport one rider via
life-flight to Memorial Herman Hospital for precautionary measures, but he
was treated and released on Saturday evening and he was back in La Grange
by 9:00 p.m.! His brother rode the MS 150 as well, so he wanted to be
there for the finish. He suffered a broken rib and is reportedly doing
fine. All other riders were treated and released by Monday morning. Most
of the medical emergencies were heat related. As you know, it was very hot
on Sunday and people simply weren't staying hydrated.

There are so many people who make this ride happen ) most of which are
volunteers. We couldn,t do the ride without our wonderful volunteers so we
can,t say thank you enough. Over half the riders participate on a
corporate or social team and each has their own group of volunteers. We'd
like to thank each of you for everything you do; we know it's a lot of
hard work!

We,d also like to introduce and thank the rest of the staff of the Lone
Star Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. You may have seen

Behind the scenes, our accounting and data entry departments work
diligently through the day and night entering new registrations and all
pledges that we,ve received. All registrations and pledges must be entered
by the Wednesday after the Tour so that we can mail pledge summary letters
on Thursday. Thanks to Brenda Chmiel, Lee Cartwright, Andrea Leday, Miles
Simmons, and Trang Bui who make this happen!

By now you should have received your pledge summary letter in the mail.
This letter indicates how much money you pledged, how much we received as
of April 17, and how much you owe, if any. Use the enclosed self-addressed
envelope to mail any remaining checks (DO NOT MAIL CASH). Make sure you
put the rider,s name on all checks.

If you raised over $400, then you qualify for one or more fundraising
prizes, as indicated in the letter. Please make sure that you CIRCLE your
choice on the invoice and return it to our office by May 19. We,ll order
the prizes at the end of May, once we,ve tallied everything up. If you do
not wish to receive a prize, then please CIRCLE DONATE BACK and return the
letter with any pledge money you have collected.

Please join us on June 28 at City Streets on Richmond Avenue near the

Believe it or not, we,ve already begun preparing for next year. Some of
you may have received a survey with your pledge summary. If so, please
take a few moments to complete the survey and return it along with any
remaining checks using the enclosed envelope. Your comments and
suggestions are helpful to us as we make improvements for next year,s
Tour. If you didn,t receive a survey, we,re still interested in your
comments, so please feel free to drop us a line.

We're gearing up for the 2000 MS 150 Bike to the Beach, a two-day bike
