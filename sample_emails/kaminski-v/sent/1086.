58.5 years.

ITS WORTH PASSING ON - PLEASE REMEMBER IT.

Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course), after an
unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired, upset and frustrated.
Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to
radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are only about five
miles from the hospital nearest your home, unfortunately you don't know if
you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do? You've been trained in
CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform
it on yourself.

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE

(Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article
seemed in order.) Without help, the person whose heart stops beating
properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before
losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each
cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum
from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about
every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is
to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and
coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The
squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this
way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Tell as many other people
as possible about this, it could save their lives!
