Shirley,

Please, send this memo to the entire group and ask if this demo was given
to anybody in our group.

Vince,

I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above 
group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more 
options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain 
what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la 
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.

Thanks,

Kevin
