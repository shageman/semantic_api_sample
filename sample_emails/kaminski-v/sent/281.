Keith,

It was a great pleasure to work you with on this project.
The entire Enron team was impressed by the quality of the students 
and commitment of the School to exploring new and creative
ways of exposing students to business problems.

Vince;

I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed working with Enron on the Tiger
Project.  I found the interaction with you and your colleagues very
stimulating.  The ideas we covered (like whether there are network
externalities in these markets) was more like a workshop than a project.  I
wish all businessmen had your interests and capabilities.

Thanks

Keith
