Vasant,

My preference is C, because of its portability. The hardware and operating 
systems
change so fast that we have to use the most flexible
development environment.

Subject: London Research Development platform

I have spoken with Bryan Seyfried and Ben Parsons on the issue of  model 
development platform, esp for Credit Trading group.  People besides Ben will 
be modeling in Bryan's group, and C is not a language they know.  One of them 
is coding in MATLAB, and the IT group is doing Visual Basic.  IT prefers not 
to support MATLAB, and would also prefer not to support C, because this would 
make their life easier.  Bryan and Ben need to make a decision as to what is 
the common platform of choice that is best for them, taking IT in mind.  Ben 
has said that if the choice is C, he can enforce everybody learn C, and can 
look into getting some function libraries (if needed).  Similarly, if the 
choice is VB, he can enforce common use of VB.
We need to of course ensure that other members of Research can crosscheck the 
code.
What are your thoughts on C, VB, or MATLAB?
