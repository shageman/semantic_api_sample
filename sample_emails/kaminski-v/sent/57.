Vince:

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a 
professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a 
statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken 
would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are 
probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if 
Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Thanks!
