Vince,

Please find attached file with propane price statistics. There are two kinds

from 1987; (2) index prices for different locations (North Sea, Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia), starting 1988. Source of both is Platts publications. 

Please notice that price of futures in given in US cents/gallon, and index 
prices in USD/MT.


Sincerely, Elena
