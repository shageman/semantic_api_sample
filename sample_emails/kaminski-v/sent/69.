Subject: Very rough draft of the "Enron Strategic Plan" to be sent to 
Professor Duffie

Hi,

 As per your request, here is a very rough draft of the document you 
requested.  It is far from being complete.

 Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

 Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Iris
