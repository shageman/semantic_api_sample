Here is your latest roster. We are up-to-date on all changes but, of
course, the students may still drop/add up to the second week of module 5.
When the time comes, please check your roster carefully and make sure that
the people on the list really are attending your course. Mistakes happen so
I just would like to make sure we have a correct record.

As always, let me know if you would like the excel folder with e-mail
addresses. I don't send them at the same time to avoid overwhelming our
e-mail system. Thanks for your help!
