Subject: Recommendation letter


Hi, Dear Vince,

How is everything going?

I wonder if you have had a chance to write me the
recommendation letter yet.  The application deadline
is coming up.  If you need any more information for
writing the letter, please let me know.  Thanks for
the help.


Best Regards,


Vincent
