Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.
