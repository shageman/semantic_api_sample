Subject: rotational opportunities within your group

Dear Vince,

I am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities 
within your group. I have worked in RAC and am currently in Financial 
Trading. I believe the Associate/Analyst program may forward you my CV, but I 
thought it good to get in touch personally. 
Please let me know if there is someone with whom I could speak about the 
group and its needs for associates. 

With best regards,
Kate
