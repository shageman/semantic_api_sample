Larry,

Vince,

Thanks for forwarding the resume.  We have generally had great success with 
ex-Koch people.
He sounds might like he may be a good fit for Michael L. Miller in principal 
investments.  At this point
I have very recently inherited two other stron VPs from EI and therefore will 
probably focus on a few
Manager and Associates for the near term but I would like to keep James' 
resume for further opportunities.
He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot 
within Wholesale Services.
What do you think?

Regards,

-Larry-
