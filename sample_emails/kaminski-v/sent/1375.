Laine,

I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer.
I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her.

I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used
primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool
in negotiations with European clients.

Vince

Vince, I am circulating the D-G Energy Software License Agreement for 
signature.  I need for you or your Senior Director to initial and I also need 
to know if you have identified an Enron Officer within IT to execute on 
behalf of Enron Corp.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
