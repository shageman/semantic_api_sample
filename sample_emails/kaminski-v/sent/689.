This is great!

SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !

Clinton isn't president

A man goes to the White House and asks to see
President Clinton.  The Marine on duty tells the
guy that Clinton isn't President any longer, please
leave.

The man goes away.

The next day he comes back to the White House and 
asks to see President Clinton.  Marine on duty tells 
the guy that Clinton is not the President any longer, 
please go away.

The man goes away.  The next day he comes back again, 
and again the same Marine is on duty.

The man asks to see President Clinton and the Marine 
says, -- WHY DO YOU KEEP COMING HERE ASKING FOR HIM?  
CLINTON IS NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE!!!

The man smiles happily and says,
"I know, I just like hearing it."
