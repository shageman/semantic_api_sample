Subject: EES Risk Management Presentations for October 25.

Please have your presentations to me by 10 AM Friday, October 20, 2000.   It 
takes a couple of days to get the materials back from the Copy Center. The 
presentations have to be put in new binders this time and it takes most of a 
day to put everything together in the binders.  Therefore, I  have to have 
the materials to the Copy Center by Friday afternoon in order to get them 
back by Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.  I will need most of Tuesday to 
get everything assembled in the binders.  Thus the necessity of having your 
completed presentations by Friday morning.

Thanks for your help on this.
