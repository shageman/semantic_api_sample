Clayton,

No problem. I asked Shirley to reschedule.

Vince-

I apologize, but something has come regarding this afternoon. My server's OS 
is acting up, and is affecting all of my apps right now.

Can we think about later this week? I promise it will be worth it to you. The 
EOL stuff is nice.

Again, my apologies.

Clayton
