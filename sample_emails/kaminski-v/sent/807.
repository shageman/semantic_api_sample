this fellow (who is negotiating a contract with John Wiley
by giving him some advice?

Good morning,

First, a reminder that you want to see follow through strength on the picks 
before going into them Secondly do you know anybody that has published a 
book? I need some help in how to negotiate points in the contract.

Thanks,   Steve
