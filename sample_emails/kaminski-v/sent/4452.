Kevin,

I would like to see the expense reports to monitor
the rate at which we approach our group budget limits.

Thanks.

Vince

Hello Everyone ,

Starting Today , 2/22/00  Mike Roberts signed a expense report.

Vince, I need to know from you if this is okay and do you want to see
them ?

Also Shirley , if Mike signs for anything else other than a expense report ,
 I will pass it by your desk whereby you can know exactly what it is.

                            
                                        Thanks
                                     Kevin Moore
Please inform........
