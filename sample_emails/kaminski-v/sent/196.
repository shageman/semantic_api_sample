Rita Hennessy called me to find out what other attendees Research was sending 
besides Zimin Lu.  You and I discussed this about 2 weeks ago and I forgot to 
remind you to let me know the names of the other 2 staffers that you want to 
send.  Please let me know so I can get in touch with Rita and we can get the 
group discount.  Thanks.  Anita
