Stinson,

I am pleased to hear your HR department is putting together an offer for
summer employment.  I enjoyed everyone I interviewed with while in Houston
and appreciated you taking the time to put together this day.

As requested, I am attaching an electronic version of my resume.  (Note it
is a slightly more updated one then the one I gave you earlier.)  It is in
Microsoft Word format.

My dates of availability are Wed., July 5 through Fri., September 15 (10
1/2 weeks).

Sincerely,
Amy Ward
