Hi Vicek,

Fuel Cells
A scientist at The University of Pennsylvania discovered a material for
fuel cells electrodes which has a potential for common applications.
Everything known before would plug-up a cell.

Biochemistry
What do you thing about Martek Biosciences (MATK).  It is the only company
in the world producing polyunsaturated fatty acids (nutritional oils).
According to very recent research results their product added to baby
formula substantially increases IQ of babies.  They are quite small now ;
however, already have licenses in several countries.  Martek is still
waiting for FDA approval in US.  Competitive product, fish oil is
contaminated with other undesired compounds.

Are you going to Poland anytime soon?
