With the passage of a new ordinance that protects existing marijuana dispensaries in Lyons, the town's board sent a clear message this week that residents who petitioned earlier this year to ban retail pot are now on their own in that fight.

At a meeting Monday night that incidentally overlapped with 4/20, the weed world's annual holiday, the Lyons trustees voted 7-0 to exempt the town's existing recreational dispensaries from a provision that mandates any retail marijuana operations must be at least 1,000 feet from each other.

The provision would have impacted The Bud Depot and Headquarters, two shops at the east entrance to town.

While Monday's ordinance proposed a very specific change, its passage symbolized a firm stance taken by a town board that has been under pressure to take action against recreational pot by those who successfully petitioned months ago to have it banned in Lyons altogether.

"We're pleased with where we are," Mayor John O'Brien said Tuesday. "We don't want a proliferation (of dispensaries), but for our small town, I think it is appropriate. These are professional, well-run, hopefully profitable businesses that will bring us not only employment but also sales tax."

Lyons, with two operating retail shops and a third — Lyons Finest — in the application process, had planned to hold a vote on the matter following a citizen petition to include a pot ban question on the town's March 24 special election ballot.

But after about 200 people — roughly one-tenth of the town — petitioned in favor of the ban, town leaders announced Feb. 12 that they were surprised to learn that such a vote would be illegal.

Amendment 64, which legalized and set policy around retail pot in the state, requires that any municipality looking to vote on a local regulation must do so in November of an even-numbered year. Thus, the soonest the petition could lead to a ballot question would be 2016.

On Feb. 18, the Lyons trustees canceled the vote, to avoid potential lawsuit, among other troubles. That night, however, they heard from about a dozen residents — a relative mob compared with the normal attendance figures for Lyons town meetings — who asked them to enact a moratorium on retail pot businesses until November 2016.

Recognizing that the town voted down a marijuana business ban in April 2012, supported Amendment 64, and voted 4-to-1 in favor of a 3.5 percent sales tax on retail pot in November, O'Brien has said that the town board will not take any further action to impede law-abiding marijuana business owners and applicants.

"This board supports legal product being sold legally through legal distribution channels," he said.

That doesn't guarantee an abundance, though. In fact, Lyons has already reached its self-imposed limit of three retail pot shops, and has similarly restrictive limits on cultivation centers and testing facilities.

"They've told us it'll only be us three," said Jose Jaramillo, manager of Lyons Finest. "It seems to me like everything is secure here and that they're trying to set these rules right."

Even with the handful of operations, however, that 3.5 percent tax likely will put a dent in the enormous amount of money Lyons is spending, and will have to keep spending, following the 2013 flood that hit the town harder than almost any other Front Range community.

"Our general fund for the town is a little over a million dollars per year," O'Brien said. "By the time this is over, we will have spent maybe 100 times our annual budget, which is more per-capita than New Orleans spent on Katrina."

Lyons officials estimate the town's 87 ongoing recovery projects, including the rebuild of two bridges, will be finished in six years.
